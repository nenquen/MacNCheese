/* Workarounds for Darling runtime bugs that are not specific to one API.
 *
 * Locks and condition variables. Darling implements the waiting part of
 * pthread mutexes and condition variables (psynch) in darlingserver: every
 * contended lock, every condition wait and every signal is a request to that
 * one server (40% of a core in game), and it loses wakeups: the RakNet
 * receive thread slept on a free mutex until the game disconnected. Its
 * condition variables also break: a timed wait that runs out is reported as
 * a wakeup, the bookkeeping goes wrong, and from then on darlingserver
 * refuses every wait on that condition variable ("psync_cvwait; invalid
 * sequence numbers" in its log, thousands a minute in game). So both wait on
 * Linux futexes here, which never involve darlingserver:
 *  - a contended pthread_mutex_lock spins briefly, then sleeps on a futex
 *    chosen by the mutex's address, which pthread_mutex_unlock wakes; the
 *    mutex itself stays Darling's (trylock and unlock);
 *  - condition variables are this file's own: a queue of waiting threads,
 *    each sleeping on its own futex, so a signal wakes exactly one of them
 *    and a broadcast exactly those waiting, never anyone else.
 * MACNCHEESE_NATIVE_MUTEX=1 and MACNCHEESE_NATIVE_COND=1 give Darling's back.
 *
 * Sleeps: in Darling every usleep and nanosleep is two darlingserver
 * requests (a cancellation check and a semaphore wait): a few threads napping
 * in a loop kept darlingserver above a whole core (124% with four, checked
 * with a test program; 11% with direct sleeps). They are direct Linux sleeps
 * here (macncheese_sleep_us for the shim itself). */
